# HR-assistant


The TalentScout Hiring Assistant is an AI-powered conversational system built using Python, Streamlit, and Groq Llama 3.1 models.
It assists recruitment teams by collecting essential candidate information and generating technical interview questions tailored to a candidate’s skill set.

This project was developed as part of the AI/ML Intern Assignment.

🚀 Features
✅ 1. Smart Greeting & Purpose Introduction

The chatbot automatically greets the user and briefly explains its role in the hiring workflow.

✅ 2. Candidate Information Collection

The assistant gathers all key candidate details, including:

Full Name

Email Address

Phone Number

Years of Experience

Desired Position

Current Location

Tech Stack (programming languages, frameworks, tools, databases)

✅ 3. Tech Stack–Driven Interview Questions

Based on the declared tech stack, the chatbot generates 3–5 relevant technical questions for each skill.

Example:
If the candidate lists Python and Django, the bot produces questions for both technologies.

✅ 4. Context-Aware Interaction

The chatbot maintains context throughout the conversation, remembering:

What information is already collected

Which details are missing

User responses across turns

✅ 5. Intelligent Fallback Mechanism

When the chatbot cannot interpret an input, it responds politely:

“Sorry, I didn’t understand that. Can you rephrase?”

✅ 6. Graceful Exit Handling

If the user types:

exit, quit, bye, stop, end


The assistant politely ends the conversation.

✅ 7. Simulated Backend Storage

Completed candidate profiles are stored in a local JSON file (candidates_store.json), serving as a simulated database.
